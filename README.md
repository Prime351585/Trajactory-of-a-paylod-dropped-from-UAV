The project detects the trajectory of a payload launched from a UAV by 
giving current longitude , latitude and Velocity x, y of UAV and longitude, 
latitude of the target. The variables are given through two files named as 
initial_waypoints.txt and final_waypoints.txt. :) also it can predict the height 
of UAV for ~99% Accuracy with plot
